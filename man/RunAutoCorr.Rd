\usage{
RunAutoCorr(
  object = NULL,
  assay = NULL,
  layer = "data",
  spatial = FALSE,
  snn.name = NULL,
  order.cells = NULL,
  prune.distance = 20,
  prune.SNN = 1/50,
  cells = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat object}

\item{assay}{Working assay}

\item{layer}{Input data. For expression, log scaled data is highly recommended}

\item{spatial}{Use spatial coordinate instead of SNN space and linear trajectory to calculate the cell-cell weight matrix.}

\item{snn.name}{name of SNN space. If spatial=FALSE and order.cells = NULL, default snn.name will set to 'RNA_snn'. Use SNN space to calculate the cell-cell weight martix.}

\item{order.cells}{For linear trajetory, input ordered cell names to calculate the cell-cell distance weight matrix. Conflict with sptaial=TRUE and snn.name != NULL.}

\item{prune.distance}{Set the cutoff for neighbors for order cells and spatial coordinates.}

\item{prune.SNN}{Sets the cutoff for acceptable Jaccard index when computing the neighborhood overlap for the SNN construction. Any edges with values less than or equal to this will be set to 0 and removed from the SNN graph. Essentially sets the stringency of pruning (0 --- no pruning, 1 --- prune everything). Default is 1/50.}

\item{cells}{Cells used for calculate weight matrix. Used with snn graph. In default will use all cells.}

\item{min.cells}{If a feature can be detect in few than min.cells, will skip to save time. Default is 10.}

\item{features}{List of features to test. Default is all features with that coverage >= min.cells.}

\item{weight.matrix.name}{Weight graph name in Seurat object. After this function, the graph can be visited by obj[[weight.matrix.name]]. Default name is "WeightMatrix", if you change the default name, you should specific the new name in \code{\link{{RunBlockCorr}}}.}

\item{prefix}{Prefix for score and p value names. Default prefix is "moransi". If you change the default name, you should specific the new name in \code{{\link{SetAutoCorrFeatures}}}.}

\item{threads}{Threads.}

\item{verbose}{Print log message. Default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{parameters pass to \code{\link{GetWeightFromSpatial}}, so it only works if spatial is TRUE.}
