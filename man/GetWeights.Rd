\arguments{
\item{snn}{Shared nearest neighbour graph, usually can found at object[["RNA_snn"]]. This graph can be calculate by Seurat::FindNeighbors().}

\item{pos}{Tissue coordinates matrix.}

\item{order.cells}{Predefined cell ranks, used for cell lineage analysis.}

\item{emb}{Cell dimesional space (PCA/ICA/harmony).}

\item{k.nn}{K-nearest neighbors, for calculating weight matrix with emb.}

\item{prune.distance}{Sets the cutoff for cell distance on lineage trajectory (ranked cells) or spatial cooridates (bin/spot distance) when computing the neighborhood overlap for the weight matrix construction. Any edges with values greater than this will be set to 0 and removed from the weight matrix graph. Default is -1 for automatic search. For lineage cells will set to length(cells)/100; for spatial coordinates, will set the distance to one unit, maximal 8 neigbors for each bin/spot.}

\item{prune.SNN}{Sets the cutoff for acceptable Jaccard index when computing the neighborhood overlap for the SNN construction. Any edges with values less than or equal to this will be set to 0 and removed from the SNN graph. Essentially sets the stringency of pruning (0 --- no pruning, 1 --- prune everything). Default is 1/50.}

\item{nn}{Nearest neighbors for spatial bins/spots/cells. Default is 8.}

\item{diag.value}{Diagnoal value in the weight matrix.}

\item{cells}{Cell list. Default use all cells.}
}
\value{
A sparse weight matrix.
